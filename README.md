# WIP !!!

## Workflow

least amount of distraction for main task (coding)

1. exploring code (nvim-tree)
2. pin files (harpoon)
3. navigate code (telescope)

## Dependencies

- lazygit
- ripgrep

## Shortcuts

Rule 1: No more than three keystrokes per shortcut

Rule 2: Shortcuts for plugins have to start with \<leader>

Rule 3: Remaps only if default vim behavior interrupts workflow (e.g. copying deleted text to register)

Everyting starts with \<leader>:
